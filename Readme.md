**What?**
This mod allows you to warp to the Phantom Ganon boss room in the Forest Temple. If you die on Phantom Ganon and the elevator gets stuck in the floor, you can use this to continue the game.

**How?**
To activate, hold dpad up and enter a loading zone. Link will enter the boss room instead of wherever you were walking to.
